It was first discovered in urban parts of the state but is being introduced to remote water bodies by floatplanes such as Sucker and Alexander Lakes in the Mat-Su Borough. Once introduced, elodea threatens salmon and makes floatplane destinations inaccessible, affecting fisheries and tourism, both vital for Alaska’s economy.\nWith the generous support from Rust\u0026rsquo;s Flying Service Devin was able to install GoPro cameras on one of Rust\u0026rsquo;s floatplanes and was able to collect images of the plane\u0026rsquo;s rudder throughout its daily operation. Devin will now use the collected images to develop a machine learning algorithm trained to automatically detect Elodea and test the feasibility for a large scale big data application. Below are images from a recent test flight that shows the Elodea infestation in Sucker Lake (Mat-Su Borough) and a video of how even small fragments of Elodea can get transmitted via floatplanes.\nBelow is a video that shows how elodea gets entangled on the floats of a de Havilland Beaver taking off from Alexander Lake, Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska.\n  ","date":1539072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538726400,"objectID":"235b1eacf142ccdf006e4ec306d6391c","permalink":"https://schwoererresearch.org/post/floatplane_cameras/","publishdate":"2018-10-09T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/post/floatplane_cameras/","section":"post","summary":"Floatplanes are one way Elodea gets transported over long distances.

This plant likely made it to Alaska through the aquarium trade. Initially discovered in urban areas of the state, elodea has since been introduced to remote water bodies by floatplanes and other pathways. Once introduced, elodea changes freshwater systems in ways that can threaten salmon and make floatplane destinations inaccessible. As a result, elodea affects fisheries and tourism, which are both vital for Alaska’s economy. Here, we integrate multiple social and ecological data to estimate the potential future economic loss associated with elodea’s introduction to remote freshwater locations. We describe how economic loss varies among stakeholder groups and regions. We find that upfront management (i.e., eradication) of all existing infestations is the optimal management strategy for minimizing long-term loss. Even though the range of future economic loss is large, the certainty of long-term damage favors early investments to eradicate current invasions and prevent new arrivals. In light of the common goal of protecting Alaska’s productive ecosystems of national and global significance, we describe the past management steps, challenges, and various outcomes associated with coordination of local partners, and state and federal agencies. We present a case study of rapid response on the Kenai Peninsula that can encourage other countries to manage elodea and other aquatic invaders (e.g., Egeria densa, Hydrilla verticillata, Myriopyllum spicatum) more proactively as these organisms spread north into a warming Arctic. We end this chapter by outlining steps for future policy making targeted at effective risk management investments that aim to retain the ecological integrity and economic value of Alaska’s vast freshwater resources.","tags":["Elodea","Aquatic Invasive Species"],"title":"Human Dimensions of Aquatic Invasive Species in Alaska: Lessons Learned While Integrating Economics, Management and Biology to Incentivize Early Detection and Rapid Response","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Effective management of Elodea across large geographic areas relies on detection of new infestations and predictions of its spread. Elodea’s increasing rate-of-spread, combined with limited detection resources, requires agencies to formalize and justify increasingly costly response actions. By better understanding elodea’s invasion processes, multi-agency response coordination can be improved to eradicate or suppress this and other economically damaging invasive aquatic plants. In collaboration with agencies, our research team consisting of Dr. Frank Witmer, Dr. Jen Schmidt (both UAA), Dr. Roman Dial (APU), and Dr. Catherine Jarnevich (USGS Fort Collins) will use existing research and data on elodea, fill knowledge gaps, and integrate available information to provide a comprehensive spatial, ecological, and economic decision support tool to predict spread, support monitoring, and optimize management. We will explore the application of remote sensing (satellite images) to detect elodea presence (new infections) combined with a meta-population model of elodea movement (our model of floatplane and boat pathways) to predict risk of invasion for uninfected water bodies, and integrate the above within a probabilistic decision analysis that’s based on existing habitat suitability models. The proposed work is applicable to the broader response to aquatic invasive species (AIS) in Alaska and will enable agencies to prepare for new aquatic invaders.\n","date":1538726400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538726400,"objectID":"d8b4d21b05a925cf616932557bf289be","permalink":"https://schwoererresearch.org/project/elodea/","publishdate":"2018-10-05T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/elodea/","section":"project","summary":"The goal of this project is to help management agencies in their decision making by integrating all available data on the ecological effects of biological invasions, human pathways, and economic benefits and costs of management action.","tags":["Elodea","Aquatic Invasive Species"],"title":"Aquatic invasive species risk management","type":"project"},{"authors":["Tobias Schwoerer","Emily O'Dean"],"categories":null,"content":" Examples of data visualizations using Alaska salmon data Below are examples of data visualizations that we generated as part of the Alaska State of Salmon and People (SASAP Project)\n   ","date":1538726400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538726400,"objectID":"12dbe230ed49f4d56b0db8b87b6c9ee1","permalink":"https://schwoererresearch.org/post/example_data_visualization/","publishdate":"2018-10-05T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/post/example_data_visualization/","section":"post","summary":"In the following examples we show how open science approaches can be used for data visualizations.","tags":["Salmon"],"title":"Data visualization using Alaska salmon data","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Alaska’s wild salmon are essential to Alaska’s cultures and economies and reflect a long tradition of stewardship.

Alaska, by contrast, had relatively few invasive species for most of the 20th century. But increased population and development in recent years have brought an influx of non-native species. However, the problem remains in its infancy, and Alaska still has the opportunity to take advantage of cost-effective management, given appropriate coordination among government agencies and private groups. To help improve such coordination and increase public understanding about this issue, the authors collected data on spending to manage invasive species in Alaska between 2007 and 2011. Such spending increased from 4.7 million in 2007 to 6.9 million in 2010, and it totaled 29 million over the entire study period. Federal agencies paid 84% of that total, non-profits paid 9%, the State of Alaska paid 5%, local governments paid 2%, and private donors paid less than 1%. Most spending (79%) targeted invasive terrestrial plants and animals, but spending for invasive marine and freshwater organisms increased over the period. The largest individual expenses were for eradicating Norway rats that were killing bird populations on an Aleutian island (5 million), northern pike that were eating juvenile salmon in lakes of Southcentral Alaska (2.7 million), and European rabbits that were destroying bird habitat in southwestern Alaska ($0.8 million). Overall, research accounted for 24%, monitoring for 20%, eradication for 20%, administration and planning for 11%, and other spending for 25% of total expenditures. The number of jobs in managing invasive species increased over the study period, as did volunteer efforts, which may suggest increasing public awareness about this issue in Alaska.
